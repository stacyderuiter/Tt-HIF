## Model fitting


```{r}
HIF_model <- gam(oxygen_cons ~ 
                   # smooth terms
                   s(exact, k = 4, bs = "ts") +
                   s(percentdailytotal, k = 4, bs = "ts") +

Standard model summary output from `gam()`:

```{r}
summary(HIF_model)
```

A prettier model summary table:

```{r}
tbl_regression(HIF_model)
```

## Model Checking

Below are `mgcv` package checks for GAMs, presented mainly to view model convergence and basis dimension checking results.

```{r}
#| label: gam-check
#| fig-show: "hide"

gam.check(HIF_model)
```

### Residual Histogram

This graph allows us to verify the residual normality condition.

```{r}
#| label: residual-histogram

gf_dhistogram(~resid(HIF_model), bins = 15) |> 
  gf_fitdistr(dist = "dnorm")
```

### Scaled Residual Plot

The scaled residual plot (Hartig, 2024) allows verification that the mean-variance relationship is as expected, particularly for mixed-effect models and generalized linear models. If all is well, scaled residuals will be trendless and will have uniform spread between 0-1 for all fitted values.

```{r}
#| label: scaled-resids
#| message: false

plotResiduals(simulateResiduals(HIF_model), quantreg = FALSE)
```

### Residual ACF Plot

The ACF plot allows us to verify the residual independence condition.

```{r}
#| label: residual-acf

acf(resid(HIF_model))
```

## Model Interpretation

### Hypothesis Testing

Type II ANOVA allows us to test the null hypothesis of no association with the response, for each predictor (and interaction) included in the model.

```{r}
anova(HIF_model)
```

### Variance Term Estimation

For random intercept terms, by analogy with the way that mixed-effect model results are usually reported and light of the fact that we wish to control for any individual or spatio-temporal effects rather than performing hypothesis testing for them, it is possible to report the standard variance components associated with each term. These are shown here in units of standard deviation. Note that since we used maximum-likelihood estimation, these estimates may be biased for finite sample size, but since variance term estimation is not the focus of inference (and smooth term hypothesis testing is) this seems like the right choice in our case. 

```{r}
#| results: hide

vars <- invisible(gam.vcomp(HIF_model)) 

vars <- vars |>
  data.frame() |>
  mutate(
    Term = rownames(vars),
    Term = ifelse(Term == "scale", "scale (residuals)", Term)
  ) |>
rename(`Standard Deviation` = std.dev,
       `CI (lower)` = lower,
       `CI (upper)` = upper
       ) |>
  select(Term,
         `Standard Deviation`, 
         `CI (lower)`, 
         `CI (upper)`) |>
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), function(x) signif(x, 3))) |>
  gt()
```

```{r}
vars
```

### Model predictions

Another way of visualizing the results of a GAM (or other regression model) is a prediction plot, where you select specific values at which to fix all the predictors other than `exact` time (age, proportion total calories, etc.) and then show predicted oxygen consumption given those values, and varying values of exact. Such a plot might be preferable to a partial plot because the y-axis is in terms of expected response variable values (in total, not a contribution to the whole from one predictor).

We used marginal means of "other" predictors; in this approach quantitative predictors are set to the mean value observed in the data, and for categorical predictors a weighted average across the observed values is used. The idea is to try to show the expected response value for "an average observation" (in some sense) in the actual data. For this reason, it may make the most sense as a set of predictions that can be overlaid on a plot of the data.

#### Marginal Means of Model Variables

```{r}
model_vars <- c('exact',
                'percentdailytotal',
                'body_mass',
                'pool_temp',
                'age',
                'sex')

tbl_summary(
    data = HIF_data,
    statistic = list(all_continuous() ~ "{mean} ({sd})", 
                      all_categorical() ~ "{n} ({p}%)"),
    type = list(all_continuous() ~ "continuous",
                all_categorical() ~ "categorical",
                age ~ "continuous"),
    # type = assign_summary_type(variables = model_vars,
    #                            cat_threshold = 3,
    #                            value = NULL),
    include = all_of(model_vars)
  )
```


#### Model Predictions

```{r}
#| label: marginal-means-preds

mmeans <- predict_response(HIF_model, terms = 'exact [0:133]',
                 margin = 'marginalmeans') 

mmeans |> 
  plot()
```


### Visualization

#### Data Plot with Model Fit


Define colors and shapes to use for plotting

```{r}
kcal_colors <- c("#E41A1C", "#377EB8", "#4DAF4A", "#984EA3")
shape_vector <- c("Tt1" = 1, "Tt2" = 2, "Tt3" = 3, "Tt4" = 4, 
                  "Tt5" = 5, "Tt6" = 6, "Tt7" = 7, "Tt8" = 8)
```


```{r}
#| label: data-plus-gam

oxygen_time_plot <- ggplot(HIF_data, 
                           aes(x = exact, y = oxygen_cons)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = factor(kcal), shape = animal), 
             size = 1, 
             stroke = 1.2) +
  geom_line(data = mmeans,
            aes(x = x, y = predicted),
            color = 'black',
            linewidth = 2) +
  geom_ribbon(data = mmeans,
              aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high, x = x),
              inherit.aes = FALSE,
              fill = 'grey44', alpha = 0.2) +
  labs(x = "Time (min)", 
       y = "Oxygen Consumption (L / min)", 
       color = "Energy Intake (kcal)", 
       shape = "Animal ID") +
  scale_color_manual(values = kcal_colors) +
  scale_shape_manual(values = shape_vector) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 14),
        axis.line = element_line(linewidth = 1)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 120, by = 20)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 2, by = 0.2))

print(oxygen_time_plot)
```

#### Area Under Curve

The calculations below show the AUC under the black line in the graph above.

For additional reference if needed, the initial value of oxygen consumption at time 0 is: `r mmeans$predicted[mmeans$x == 0]`

To find the cumulative area under the curve, using the marginal mean expected $0_2$ consumption values, we could do something like:

```{r}
predicted_AUC <- data.frame(minutes = mmeans$x,
                            AUC = cumtrapz(x = mmeans$x,
                                           y = mmeans$predicted))
max(predicted_AUC$AUC)
```

The total at 130 minutes is: `r max(predicted_AUC$AUC)`. Below the cumulative sums are shown:

```{r}
#| label: cum-auc

ggplot(predicted_AUC,
       aes(x = minutes, y = AUC)) +
  geom_path()
```

To compute this quantity with uncertainty, we would probably employ a parametric bootstrap (not done yet).

# Breathing Frequency Model

Based on the discussion in the manuscript, I think maybe this is what we need...

Methods would say,

>> We also fitted a normal GAM to quantify the association (if any) between the dependent variable tidal volume and breathing frequency. The model included smooths of breathing frequency as well as time since feeding, energy intake, age, and body mass, plus the categorical predictor sex and random effects of animal ID and day of trial. Settings, including basis type and dimension, were all the same as for the oxygen consumption GAM.

```{r}
breath_model <- gam(tidal_vol ~ s(Breath_freq, bs = "ts", k = 4) + 
                      s(exact, bs = "ts", k = 4) + 
                      s(age, bs = "ts", k = 4) + 
                      s(body_mass, bs = "ts", k = 4) + 
                      s(percentdailytotal, k = 4, bs = "ts") + 
                      # s(pool_temp, k = 4, bs = "ts") +
                      # sex +
                      # random effects 
                      s(animal, bs = "re") + 
                      s(day, bs = "re"), data = HIF_data)
```

Standard model summary output from `gam()`:

```{r}
summary(breath_model)
```

A prettier model summary table:

```{r}
tbl_regression(breath_model)
```

## Model Checking

Below are `mgcv` package checks for GAMs, presented mainly to view model convergence and basis dimension checking results.

```{r}
#| label: gam-check-breath
#| fig-show: "hide"

gam.check(breath_model)
```

### Residual Histogram

This graph allows us to verify the residual normality condition.

```{r}
#| label: residual-histogram-breath

gf_dhistogram(~resid(breath_model), bins = 15) |> 
  gf_fitdistr(dist = "dnorm")
```

### Scaled Residual Plot

The scaled residual plot (Hartig, 2024) allows verification that the mean-variance relationship is as expected, particularly for mixed-effect models and generalized linear models. If all is well, scaled residuals will be trendless and will have uniform spread between 0-1 for all fitted values.

```{r}
#| label: scaled-resids-breath
#| message: false

plotResiduals(simulateResiduals(breath_model), quantreg = FALSE)
```

### Residual ACF Plot

The ACF plot allows us to verify the residual independence condition.

```{r}
#| label: residual-acf-breath

acf(resid(breath_model))
```

## Model Interpretation

### Hypothesis Testing

Type II ANOVA allows us to test the null hypothesis of no association with the response, for each predictor (and interaction) included in the model.

```{r}
anova(breath_model)
```

The main result here is the p-value for `Breath_freq`, which is very small (6.7e-5). We can interpret this as strong evidence that tidal volume and breathing frequency are associated, (even after controlling for possible effets of time since feeding, age, mass, food amount, temperature, individual and trial day).

### Visualization

Candidate for Figure 3?

```{r}
gf_point(tidal_vol ~ Breath_freq, data = HIF_data)
```


What the model says (for average of all predictors in the dataset)

```{r}
predict_response(breath_model, terms = "Breath_freq [all]",
                 condition = list(exact = 0)) |>
  plot() 
```
